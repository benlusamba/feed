# Feed Application

This application leverages ```curl``` requests, media APIs, and regular expressions for NLP. The first layer of this application performs the unstructured data sourcing and cleaning. The second layer of this application - currently in development - employs natural language processing for predictive modelling. **Financial markets** (FX, Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities) are of interest in this project.
