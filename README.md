# Feed Application

This application leverages ```curl``` requests, media APIs, and regular expressions for NLP. The first layer of this application performs the unstructured data sourcing and cleaning. The second layer of this application - currently in development - employs natural language processing for predictive modelling. **Financial markets** (FX, Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities) are of interest in this project.

**Repository Components**:

1. Application Architecture (forthcoming) 
2. Unstructured data sourcing script: <a href="https://github.com/benlusamba/feed/blob/master/req.py" target="_blank">req.py</a>
3. Pre-processing of unstructured data
4. Text Search (Rank and Sort)
5. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
