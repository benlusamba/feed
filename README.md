# Feed Application

This application leverages ```curl``` requests, News APIs, and regular expressions for NLP. The first layer of this application performs the unstructured data sourcing and cleaning. The seconde layer of this application - currently in development - employs natural language processing techniques for predictive work. Financial markets (FX, Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities) are of great interest in this project.
